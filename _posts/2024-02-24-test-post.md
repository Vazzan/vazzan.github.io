### Intro

The purpose of this post is to show off the Level Streaming Helper which was created to help with setup on [Tales of Kenzera: ZAU](https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/tales-of-kenzera/zau) \
the intention isn't to do a deep dive into the system itself but a brief overview will be given to provide enough context

### Level Streaming

One of the objectives for the level streaming system on Zau was to allow the player to explore the game world without hitting loading screens \
This was achieved by splitting our world up into Biomes, Sub-biomes, Groups and Sets \

A Set is a Data Asset which contains an Array of Unreal Levels to load\
A Group is a Data Asset which contains 1 or more Sets

An Unreal Level can only be part of 1 Set, but a Set can be part of many Groups\
When a Player is in the game the area they are in will be 1 Group

An example of their heirarchy for the purpose of level streaming is;
* Biome - Highlands (HL), Woodlands (WL), Deadlands (DL), etc
	* Sub-biome - 01, 02, 03, etc
		* Group - a, b, c, etc
			* Set - a, b, Design, Nav, etc
		
Meaning an example of a Data File that is used to drive the Level Streaming System would be HL01a, HL01b, HL02a, etc
